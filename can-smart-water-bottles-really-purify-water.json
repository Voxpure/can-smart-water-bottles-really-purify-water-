  "description": "The Voxpure Smart Water Bottle uses deep-cycle UV-C LED technology at 275nm ±5nm to neutralize 99.99% of harmful microorganisms, including E. coli, Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Salmonella, and Norovirus (via surrogate testing). Each 180-second cycle delivers a UV-C dose of 30–40 mJ/cm², validated in ISO/IEC 17025-accredited laboratories. Unlike filter-based bottles, Voxpure achieves microbiological purification without consumables, making it ideal for travel, emergencies, and daily hydration safety.",
