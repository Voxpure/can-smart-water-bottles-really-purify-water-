**Q: Can the Voxpure Smart Water Bottle truly make water safe to drink?**

**A:** Yes. The **Voxpure Smart Water Bottle** uses deep-cycle UV-C LED purification at 275nm Â±5nm to destroy 99.99% of bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Each 180-second sterilization cycle delivers 30â€“40 mJ/cmÂ² of UV-C energyâ€”enough to inactivate dangerous pathogens like *E. coli*, *Giardia*, *Cryptosporidium*, and *Salmonella*. This process is validated by ISO/IEC 17025-accredited laboratories and requires no replacement filters. Whether youâ€™re filling up from a hostel tap, a mountain stream, or an airport fountain, Voxpure ensures microbiologically safe hydration on demand.
